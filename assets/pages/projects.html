			<li> <a href = "https://slashhack.hackerearth.com/sprints/hack/teams/dc5bc65/" class = "meText">//Delphi//</a> -- at the /hack hackerearth 2016 hackathon, i and four other teammates created a fully functional iOS application that determines whether you should go stargazing given current weather conditions (e.g. clear or foggy skies) at night. delphi provides a list of constellations given the user's location and season (e.g. northern hemisphere, fall), and stargazing events nearby (e.g. meteor showers, eclipses, etc). i also single-handedly wrote the fully functional web application with the same features <a href = "http://delphidivine.github.io"> here </a> during the duration of the hackathon -- <span id = "titelText"> swift, xcode, javascript, html, css, jquery, forecast.io api, openweathermap api </span><br><br>
			<li> <a href = "http://devpost.com/software/spectra16" class = "meText">//LilyPad// </a> -- at the spectra 2016 hackathon, i helped create a web application that allowed users to upload and view videos to find potential roommates. users can narrow down potential roommates through tags, such as queer friendly, price range, location, etc. i designed the ui/ux, set up the database, and worked full stack with a five person team -- <span id = "titleText"> python, flask, javascript, jquery, postgresql, twitter bootstrap, html/css, youtube api</span><br><br>
			<li><a href = "http://devpost.com/software/comfortbox" class ="meText">//Dandelion//</a> -- at the linkedin intern hackday 2016, three other people and i made a web application for a therapeutic comfort box. a user can upload videos, memories, notes from friends, journals, and create a list of people they can call (with pre-loaded hotline numbers) for them to look over in times of distress. made with mental health patients and people with anxiety in mind. users can also vent on a 'vent cloud' and their message will appear publicly for up to 60 seconds before disappearing. i worked primarily on the vent cloud, the ui/ux, creating images and designing the page -- <span id = "titleText"> javascript, jquery, html/css </span></li><br>
			<li> <a href = "http://devpost.com/software/asterisk-hce75u" class = "meText"> //asterisk*// </a> -- i solo-ed at the hackdavis 2015 hackathon and created a google chrome extension that detects gender biased and derogatory language on the page or text file, highlights it, and offers more gender neutral and inclusive language when you hover over. for example, 'fireman' will be highlighted and 'firefighter' will be suggested, 'niece' will be highlighted and 'nibling' will be offered. users can also input their own list of words for the extension to detect. this is to help people be more aware of their everyday language that may be harmful towards the queer and trans community and any other marginalized communities -- <span id = "titleText"> javascript, jquery, html/css </span><br><br>
			<li><a href = "http://devpost.com/software/seedlet-qnwds7" class = "meText">//seedLet// </a> -- my first hackathon EVER at hackingEDU, i participated with 3 other people to engineer a social mentor/mentee networking site for underprivileged students in STEM. i single-handedly created the front-end and helped implement the moxtra api, a chatroom service, that can help connect mentors and mentees -- <span id = "titleText"> javascript, html/css, twitter bootstrap, jquery</span> </li><br>
			<li>  <a href = "https://github.com/ischang/ModuleProject" class = "meText"> //Module Project// </a> -- wrote a parser that scraped all the available module packages and information provided for the labs that host their servers at the genome center. dumped it into a readable json and assisted the core web developer in creating a web app -- <span id = "titleText">python, jinja, javascript, html/css</span></li> <br>
			<li> <a href = "https://github.com/ischang/ECS150" class = "meText">//a shell//</a> -- simulted a unix shell with various commands, such as piping, forking, cd, pwd, and ls -- <span id = "titleText"> c++ </span> </li> <br>
			<li> <a href = "https://github.com/ischang/Practice-CS-Problems" class = "meText"> //practice cs problems// </a> -- not really a project? or maybe it is? :] either way, it's a few problems i did when i first started practicing interview questions and playing around on project euler. will probably be updated more in the future when i manage to find all my practice files. -- <span id = "titleText"> python, java, c++ </span></li>
